Install Instructions
--------------------
##git

###Windows
Install Git for Windows by download and running
      <a href="https://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe">the installer</a>
      This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.


###Mac
Installing Git may require you to first install XCode.
	This is a very large download (several gigabytes),
	so please do it <strong>before</strong> arriving at the bootcamp.

For Mac OS X 10.7 and higher: 
Go to the
 [Xcode website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
Get XCode from the App Store making
certain to install the command line tools (from the
Download preferences pane). Git is included in the
command line tools.

For Mac OS X 10.6: 
If you have Mac OS X 10.6,
first get XCode by going to
[the Apple developer site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). 
You have to sign in with an Apple ID linked to a Developer account.
If you don't have one,
you can register and create one.
Once you log in,
go to page 8 and find "XCode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 for Snow Leopard".
Click to open that section,
and then download the <code>.dmg</code> file.
Finally,
[install just git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3).


###Linux
You don't need instructions if you have Linux.  
 
Just kidding.  

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
